## Documentation

[*certvalidator* documentation](docs/readme.md)

## Continuous Integration

 - [Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/wbond/certvalidator/history) via AppVeyor
 - [OS X & Linux](https://travis-ci.org/wbond/certvalidator/builds) via Travis CI
 - [Test Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/wbond/certvalidator/commits) via Codecov

## Testing

Tests are written using `unittest` and require no third-party packages:

```bash
python run.py tests
```

To run only some tests, pass a regular expression as a parameter to `tests`.

```bash
python run.py tests path
```

### Test Cases

The test cases for the library are comprised of:

 - [Public Key Interoperability Test Suite from NIST](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/crypto_apps_infra/pki/pkitesting.html)
 - [OCSP tests from OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/test/recipes/80-test_ocsp.t)
 - Various certificates generated for TLS certificate validation

## Development

To install required development dependencies, execute:

```bash
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

The following commands will run the linter and test coverage:

```bash
python run.py lint
python run.py coverage
```

The following will regenerate the API documentation:

```bash
python run.py api_docs
```

The following will run a test that connects to all (non-adult) sites in the
Alexa top 1000 that respond on port 443:

```bash
python run.py stress_test
```

Once the script is complete, results that differ between the OS validation and
the *certvalidator* validation will be listed for further debugging.

After creating a [semver](http://semver.org/) git tag, a `.tar.gz` and `.whl`
of the package can be created and uploaded to
[PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/certvalidator) by executing:

```bash
python run.py release
```
